# turing-machine-emulator

Simple emulator of k-taped Turing machines. Intended to be used as supplementary material to "Theory of programming" course in Novosibirsk State University (see https://github.com/Svazars/theory-of-programming-notes).


## How to use

- Ensure `java` is installed on your computer (e.g. `java -version` should print something).
- Download latest stable release (https://github.com/Svazars/turing-machine-emulator/releases/) or built emulator from sources.
- Unzip release archive.
- `cd samples/HelloWorld_1d` and run `run.sh`. You should see successful emulation of simple HelloWorld program.
- Use `java -jar turing-machine-emulator.jar -help` to get list of available options.

Now you could play around with other samples and start writing your own programs for Turing machines!
